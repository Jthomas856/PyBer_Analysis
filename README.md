# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride-sharing data by city type. Then we will be creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This data will be used to analyze how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer.
