# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride-sharing data by city type. Then we will be creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This data will be used to analyze how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer.

- Consistently on a weekly basis, urban cities have the highest total fares and rural cities have the lowest total fares.

## Summary

Urban cities have the highest amount of total rides, however the amount of drivers far exceeds the total rides. This creates more supply than demand and drives the fares down. On the other side of this, suburban and rural cities have a shortage in supply because there are more rides than drivers, causing the fares to rise. Drivers are making less than the average fare in urban cities because of the over supply, and to correct this Pyber can create incentives to disperse drivers to suburban and rural areas which would help with the shorage in these areas. Rural cities have the largest shorage with 1.6 rides for every driver and an average fare  of $34.62. Due to the higher fares in rural areas, this could be discouraging riders there to use the service. Pyber could consider incentivizing riders to use their service by lowering fares in these areas. The same could be done in suburban areas where there are more rides than drivers and fares are higher. Finding a good balance between total rides and total drivers in each city type is key to balance average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Reasonable fares for riders could lead to more total rides which increases revenue for Pyber. Pyber also has to maintain its drivers to susutain business and will need to compensate them fairly to keep them. Currently in urban cities, which bring in the most revenue, drivers are making the least amount per ride so finding a balance here will keep drivers.
